        <p>One of the most notable features of Stone Mountain is the Confederate Memorial Carving, the largest bas-relief sculpture in the world. Carved into the side of the mountain, this impressive sculpture depicts three Confederate leaders: Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Stonewall Jackson. Aside from its historical signiÔ¨Åcance, Stone Mountain is also a hub for outdoor activities. Visitors can enjoy hiking, biking, and scenic railroad tours, as well as a variety of family-friendly attractions and events.</p>
